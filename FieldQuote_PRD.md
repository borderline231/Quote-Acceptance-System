## 1. üß≠ Overview

**Goal:**  
To build an Android app that simplifies field service quoting and invoicing by allowing users to input service types, rates (per foot, flat, etc.), and generate professional multi-option quotes or single-option invoices as PDFs. The app also helps calculate potential earnings before finalizing any document.

- Field service providers (insulation, demolition, fencing, flooring, etc.)  
- Contractors and small business owners  
- Sales reps working on-site with clients

## 2. üéØ Key Objectives

- Let users select and enter service types and pricing.
- Allow earnings preview via dynamic calculations (e.g., $3/ft √ó 250 ft = $750).
- Support multiple pricing options per quote (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium).
- Generate professional PDF documents (quotes/invoices).
- Share via SMS, WhatsApp, or email directly from app.
- Save client/job info locally for reuse.
